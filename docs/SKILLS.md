## Developer Setup & Hygiene

### Pre-Commit Hooks — Auto-Fix on Every Commit

This repo uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically fix formatting and line-ending issues **before any commit is recorded**. Most hooks are auto-fixers — they silently reformat files so the commit succeeds on the second attempt.

> **Detector hooks that block by design**: `check-json`, `check-yaml`, `check-toml` (config syntax errors), `check-merge-conflict` (stray `<<<<<<<`), `debug-statements` (stray `breakpoint()`). These require manual fixes before committing.

**First-time setup** (once per machine, per clone):
```sh
pip install pre-commit          # or: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install              # installs hooks into .git/hooks/
```
The three Python runners (Console, Web, Test) call `pre-commit install` automatically on first local, non-CI run. For CSharp, Node, and Server runners — or direct git use — run it manually once after cloning.

**What happens on `git commit`:**
1. `ruff-format` rewrites Python files with wrong indentation/quotes/blank-lines
2. `ruff --fix` applies safe lint fixes
3. `end-of-file-fixer` and `mixed-line-ending` normalise LF/CRLF
4. `trailing-whitespace` strips trailing spaces
5. `eslint-node-client` lints Node Client JS (`.js`, `.mjs`)
6. `css-node-client` runs the Node Client CSS checker
7. `eslint-web-client` lints Web Client JS (`src/javascripts/`, `config.js`)
8. `stylelint-web-client` lints Web Client CSS (`src/resources/css/`)
9. `workflow-policy-guard` runs the root workflow/baseline policy tests when workflow YAML, `tests/test_root_runner.py`, or the Integration test-count baseline changes
10. `check-github-workflows` validates workflow files against the GitHub Actions schema
11. `zizmor` audits workflow security at the same High/Critical severity policy used by the root runner

JS hooks (#5–#8) run with the project's own `node_modules` via `npm --prefix` — no global
install required. They only trigger when matching files are staged.
The CI `pre-commit` job runs the same hook set on all files and skips only the
npm-backed JS hooks, because the dedicated Node and Web JavaScript CI jobs own
their full `npm ci` setup and lint/audit gates.

Multi-exception style rule: always write `except (A, B):`, never `except A, B:`. This is enforced
by the unit-level guard test (`test_ruff_format_guard.py`) which verifies ruff does not corrupt
parenthesized except clauses — see **Key Technical Decisions** below.

If any hook modifies files, the commit is aborted. **Run `git add -u && git commit` again** — fixed files are already staged.

**Auto-generated files excluded**: `OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_CSharp_Client/Types/` is excluded from all hooks (set in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and root `pyproject.toml`). Never edit those files manually.

---

### Virtual Environment Naming Convention

Each Python project uses separate environments for runtime, tests, and containerized runs:

| Directory | Created by | Contents | Typical use |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `.venv` | `setup_client.py` / `setup_project.py` | `requirements.txt` only | `python main.py` / standalone launch (Windows, Linux, macOS, WSL) |
| `.venv_test` | `run_all_tests.py` | `requirements.txt` + `requirements-dev.txt` | Normal local test runs |
| `.venv_ci` | `run_all_tests.py --ci-mode` (local only) | `requirements.txt` + `requirements-dev.txt` | Local CI-mode mirror without using system Python |
| `/opt/ijt_venv` | Docker `ENTRYPOINT` | `requirements.txt` | Docker container runtime |

> **WSL**: `bootstrap_wsl.sh` calls `setup_project.py` after OS provisioning — uses `.venv` like every other host.

Use `.venv` for running the application, `.venv_test` for normal local tests, and `.venv_ci` for local `--ci-mode` runs. Do not mix them.

Both `setup_*.py` and `run_all_tests.py` remove stale legacy directories (`venv/`, `venv_test/`, `env/`, `ENV/`, `.venv_backup/`) on startup. A fresh clone always starts clean automatically.

---

### Running Tests — Project Isolation

Run tests from each project's own directory, not from the repo root.

```sh
# ✅ Correct — run from project directory
cd OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_Web_Client && pytest tests/python/unit/
cd OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_Console_Client && pytest tests/unit

# ❌ Wrong — from repo root, both conftest.py files collide
pytest OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_Web_Client/tests OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_Console_Client/tests
```

Running multiple Python clients together in a single root `pytest` invocation causes `ImportPathMismatchError` because both trees have `tests/conftest.py`. The CI workflows and `run_all_tests.py` both enforce per-project `working-directory`.

**For local full-suite runs**: Use each project's `run_all_tests.py` from its own directory, or the repo root orchestrator which delegates each runner with the correct `cwd`.
The root orchestrator forces Python child runners to UTF-8 output so nested
runner banners, skip reasons, and advisory tool messages render consistently on
Windows terminals and captured logs.
Use `python run_all_tests.py --ci-mode` when a local run must exercise the same
CI codepaths as GitHub Actions; the flag sets `CI=1` before child runners start.
Local `--ci-mode` Python suites use `.venv_ci`; only `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` or
`IS_DOCKER=true` may use the provided `sys.executable` directly.

---

### Pytest Temp Root Policy

All three Python clients use a **project-local** `tmp/pytest/` directory as the pytest basetemp so that temp files
are always created under the repo tree and gitignored automatically.  Set `IJT_USE_SYSTEM_BASETEMP=1` to override
and use the OS default temp location instead.

| Project | Basetemp configuration |
|---------|------------------------|
| `IJT_Console_Client` | `pytest_configure` hook in `conftest.py` (CWD-independent absolute path) |
| `IJT_Test_Client` | `pytest_configure` hook in `conftest.py` |
| `IJT_Web_Client` | `pytest_configure` hook in `tests/conftest.py` |

`tmp/` is gitignored in each project. `tmp_path_retention_policy = "failed"` retains artifacts only for failing tests.

---

### Automatic Cleanup — post-run

Every `run_all_tests.py` calls `_cleanup_caches()` after writing reports. Cleanup is **self-contained** — each runner only cleans its own directory tree.

| Runner | Scope | Removes |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Sub-project runners | Own project dir (recursive) | `__pycache__`, `.ruff_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.coverage*`, `*.pyc` |
| Root orchestrator | Repo root only (non-recursive) | Same + `pki/`, `PKI/` |

`.pytest_cache` is cleaned post-run (regenerates on next run; `--lf`/`--ff` only work within the same session). Always preserved: `test-results/` (reports). The root orchestrator may create `tmp/runner-env/` for delegated tool caches; it is runtime state and must remain untracked.

---

### pyfakefs — Filesystem-Touching Unit Tests

`IJT_Console_Client` and `IJT_Web_Client` use **`pyfakefs`** for all unit tests that simulate virtual environment layouts. The `fs` fixture intercepts `pathlib`, `os`, `shutil`, and `zipfile` calls in-process — no real files are written for those tests, eliminating OS ACL issues on Windows (writing `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` can trigger security policies that lock containing directories).

```python
# After — all filesystem ops are in-memory, no real disk writes
def test_finds_direct_exe(self, fs, monkeypatch):
    exe = Path("/fake/sim") / sc.SIMULATOR_EXE_NAME
    exe.parent.mkdir(parents=True)
    exe.write_bytes(b"fake exe")
```

`pyfakefs~=6.1` is in `requirements-dev.txt` for both Console and Web clients. Works identically on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

The `tests/fixtures/` directory is created at runtime by `conftest.py` (`pytest_configure`) — no `.gitkeep` needed.

---

### Coverage Configuration

Coverage is configured in each project's `pyproject.toml`. **Never hardcode thresholds in runner scripts** — config files are the version-controlled source of truth.

| Project | `fail_under` | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Web Client | **95%** | Configured in `pyproject.toml` — applies to Python unit run. |
| Console Client | **95%** | Configured in `pyproject.toml` — applies to unit run |
| Test Client | **95%** | Configured in `pyproject.toml` — live-test-only helpers reduce coverage on conformance-only runs; `tests/unit/` supplements with pure-logic coverage |

Python coverage gates measure runtime application/helper code and intentionally omit tests, virtual environments, local setup scripts, runner scaffolding, and live-only tests.

**C# Client (coverlet)**: Exclusions defined in `coverlet.runsettings` — excludes `UAModel` (auto-generated OPC UA type bindings) and `Program` namespaces, plus `[GeneratedCode]`, `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]`, and `[CompilerGeneratedAttribute]` attributes. CI passes `--settings coverlet.runsettings` to `dotnet test` so exclusions are applied to both collection and the summary table.
The C# runner treats 95% as the advisory line-coverage floor for the non-generated client code it parses from Cobertura output.

**Node Client (JavaScript/Vitest)**: Coverage threshold is NOT in pyproject.toml (JS project).
- Hard gate: `coverage.thresholds.lines = 95` in `vitest.config.mjs`
- Ratchet floor: `_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 95.0` in `IJT_Node_Client/run_all_tests.py` — WARN-only, advisory/non-gated. Aspirational goal: 100%.
- Coverage reporters: `text-summary`, `cobertura` — the cobertura XML is parsed by the CI report job

**Web Client JS (Vitest)**: Threshold enforced at 95% via `vitest.config.mjs` `thresholds.lines`. Reporters: `text`, `lcov`, `cobertura`.

---

### Runner Step Result Model — PASS / WARN / FAIL / SKIP

All Python runner scripts (`run_all_tests.py`) use a `_StepResult` class with four distinct states. **Do not collapse WARN into PASS or FAIL** — the distinction is enforced by unit tests.

| Field | State | Colour | Counts as | Use for |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|---------|
| `ok=True, warn=False` | **PASS** | green | `passed` | Tool ran clean |
| `warn=True` | **WARN** | yellow | `warned` (never `failed`) | Advisory tool: ran but output unreadable, or found non-critical issues |
| `ok=False, warn=False` | **FAIL** | red | `failed` → suite FAIL | Real defect or gate violation |
| `skipped=True` | **SKIP** | yellow | `skipped` | Tool not installed / Not Applicable |

**Advisory tool rule**: Tools whose failures are inherently non-actionable on the local/CI environment (Semgrep SSL, pyright advisory, pip-audit network) must use `result.warn = True` or `skipped=True` — **never** `result.ok = False`. Setting `ok=False` converts an advisory observation into a suite-blocking failure. Actionable dependency findings are different: `pip-audit` findings with fix versions must fail the owning Python check; advisory-only findings may pass with an explicit note.

**Semgrep preflight rule**: When a runner uses `--config=p/default`, the network preflight must probe `https://semgrep.dev/c/p/default`, not only `https://semgrep.dev/`. Use `requests` when available so the preflight follows the same certifi/TLS trust path as Semgrep and pip-audit. Keep `requests` optional inside the helper and annotate that import with `# type: ignore[import-untyped]` unless `types-requests` is a required dev dependency. Optional imports used by runner/report tooling are covered by the root optional-import typing guard, including untyped imports and forward-annotation/reimport patterns that mypy flags as `no-redef`. The root host can be reachable while the rule download path fails TLS/auth, which otherwise costs roughly 100 seconds and emits traceback noise before producing the same advisory WARN.

**pip-audit preflight rule**: pip-audit must preflight `https://pypi.org/pypi/pip/json`, not the PyPI root page, and must use `--progress-spinner off`, `--timeout 5`, and a project-local `--cache-dir`. Local parent-process timeout should be short (30s); CI can be longer (90s). Network/TLS/timeout outcomes are advisory skips, not PASS and not FAIL. If pip-audit reports fixable CVEs or exits with CVEs but no JSON report, the suite fails closed.

**npm install noise rule**: Runner-managed and Dockerfile dependency installs must pass `--no-audit --no-fund` to `npm ci` / `npm install` so repeated local and CI runs do not print funding/audit summaries. Dockerfile npm commands should also disable the npm update notifier. Child runners that invoke npm directly should use a repo-local npm cache and disable the npm update notifier when they own the subprocess environment. Keep `npm audit` as a separate explicit security step; do not rely on install-time audit output.

**Root child environment rule**: The root orchestrator sets repo-local defaults for Python/npm child-process caches (`PIP_CACHE_DIR`, `npm_config_cache`) under `tmp/runner-env/`, disables the npm update notifier, and forces UTF-8 Python output. Do not override `DOTNET_CLI_HOME` or `NUGET_PACKAGES` by default: local/offline runs should keep using standard .NET/NuGet behavior unless the caller explicitly chooses another location. Explicit caller-provided environment variables still win.

The invariant is unit-tested in `tests/unit/test_runner_step_result.py` in both Console Client and Test Client:
- `test_semgrep_parse_failure_sets_warn_not_fail` — parse failure must set `warn=True`
- `test_counter_mixed_suite_warn_does_not_cause_suite_fail` — `warned > 0` with `failed = 0` must still pass

**Summary line format**: `Result: PASS  passed=12  warned=1  failed=0  skipped=1`

Docstring coverage (`interrogate`) thresholds — calibrated against real codebase with venvs excluded:

| Project | `fail-under` | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Console Client | 25% | Honest floor; tests included in scan |
| Web Client | 42% | Honest floor; tests included in scan |
| Test Client | 65% | Higher bar; source is well-documented |

### Windows Temp Directory Notes

On Windows, pyfakefs and pytest can leave directories with restricted ACLs that survive test teardown.
Built-in protections already in place:

| Protection | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| `_force_rmtree(path)` | All 7 runners + 2 setup scripts — `shutil.rmtree(onexc=...)` with `os.chmod` retry for read-only files |
| `[tool.mypy] exclude` | Skips `pytest-cache-files-*` before mypy walks into them |
| `norecursedirs` | pytest never collects from `pytest-cache-files-*` or `tmp` |
| `-p no:cacheprovider` (all 3 Python clients) | Prevents `pytest-cache-files-*` creation entirely |
| `.dockerignore` | `tests/fixtures/tmp/` excluded from Docker build context |
| Project-local basetemp | All Python clients write to `tmp/pytest/` instead of system temp |

If a directory is owned by a different OS user (e.g. a CI service account), `_force_rmtree` cannot remove it —
Windows requires owner rights or `SeBackupPrivilege` for deletion.  Use `takeown` + `icacls` as Administrator to
recover such directories.

---

### Manual Deep Clean

```bash
git clean -fdXn                                                              # preview first
git clean -fdX -e 'venv' -e '.venv*' -e 'node_modules' -e 'OPC_UA_IJT_Server_Simulator*'
```

`-X` removes only gitignored files — never touches committed or untracked files.

| Item | Why preserved |
|------|--------------|
| `venv/`, `.venv*` | Python environments — slow to recreate |
| `node_modules/` | npm cache — slow to recreate |
| `OPC_UA_IJT_Server_Simulator*` | Large extracted binary |

## Sub-Project Summary

### IJT Web Client (`OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_Web_Client/`)
- **Stack**: Python 3.14+, asyncua pinned via repo-root constraints.txt, Node.js 24+, Vitest, ESLint, Docker
- **Tests**: Python unit (`tests/python/unit/`), JS unit (`src/javascripts/`), and split live suites for Python OPC UA, Python WebSocket backend, Python WebSocket lifecycle, Playwright smoke, Playwright features, and Playwright regression. Each live/browser suite owns its own OPC UA/WS/UI ports; root Phase 2 runs Docker as a separate `web-client-docker-smoke` suite.
- **One test command**: `python run_all_tests.py`
- **Docker**: standalone smoke is healthy on HTTP:3000 + WS:8001; root Phase 2 isolates Docker smoke on HTTP:3008 + WS:8011
- **Details**: read `OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_Web_Client/docs/SKILLS.md`

### IJT Console Client (`OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_Console_Client/`)
- **Stack**: Python 3.14+, asyncua pinned via repo-root constraints.txt
- **Tests**: unit (`tests/unit/` — no server needed); live (`tests/live/` — calls `pytest.fail()` if server unreachable, no silent skips)
- **One test command**: `python run_all_tests.py` (auto-launches server if needed)
- **Entry point**: `python setup_client.py --url="opc.tcp://..."`
- **Details**: read `OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_Console_Client/docs/SKILLS.md`

### IJT Test Client (`OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_Test_Client/`)
- **Stack**: Python 3.14+, asyncua pinned via repo-root constraints.txt, pytest
- **Purpose**: OPC UA IJT spec conformance test suite — validates server against OPC 40450-1 / 40451-1
- **Tests**: conformance (`conformance/` — requires running OPC UA server); unit (`tests/unit/` — pure-logic helper coverage, no server needed)
- **One test command**: `python run_all_tests.py` (auto-launches server if needed)
- **Details**: read `OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_Test_Client/docs/SKILLS.md`

### IJT CSharp Client (`OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_CSharp_Client/`)
- **Stack**: C# .NET 10+, OPC Foundation UA SDK, xUnit, Moq, coverlet
- **Purpose**: C# reference OPC UA IJT client — events, results, assets, joining process, and joint management
- **Architecture**: `JoiningSystem` holds `ISession` (OPC UA SDK) directly; no wrapper. `IJoiningSystem` is the interface for management classes and Moq mocks. `IjtSession`/`IIjtSession` do not exist.
- **Tests**: xUnit unit tests + live integration tests (skipped unless `OPCUA_SERVER_URL` or `OPCUA_SIMULATOR_EXE` is set)
- **One test command**: `python run_all_tests.py` (dotnet build + test + NuGet CVE scan)
- **Details**: read `OPC_UA_Clients/Release2/IJT_CSharp_Client/docs/SKILLS.md`

### IJT Node Client (`OPC_UA_Clients/Release1/IJT_Node_Client/`)
- **Stack**: Node.js 24+, node-opcua, Socket.io, Vitest, Playwright
- **Purpose**: Node.js + browser OPC UA IJT client (Release 1)
- **One test command**: `python run_all_tests.py` (quiet npm ci + vitest + eslint + explicit npm audit)
- **E2E tests**: 27 Playwright specs in `tests/e2e/` — skip gracefully in CI (no server); run locally with `node index.js` then `npx playwright test`
- **Details**: read `OPC_UA_Clients/Release1/IJT_Node_Client/docs/SKILLS.md`

---

## OPC UA IJT Server (Simulator)

- **Default endpoint**: `opc.tcp://localhost:40451`
- **Location**: `OPC_UA_Servers/Release2/` — Windows installer ZIP + Linux binary ZIP + smoke tests
- **Start (Windows)**: run `opcua_ijt_demo_application.exe` as Administrator
- **Start (Linux)**: `chmod +x opcua_ijt_demo_application && ./opcua_ijt_demo_application`
- **Start (Docker)**: `docker compose up` from `OPC_UA_Servers/Release2/`
- **Smoke tests**: `python OPC_UA_Servers/Release2/tests/smoke_test.py` — 10 checks, fails fast if asyncua missing; pass `--junitxml PATH` to emit JUnit XML for CI reporting
- **Key simulation methods** (all require boolean `IsSimulated` argument):
  - `SimulateResults` — single tightening result
  - `SimulateBulkResults` — multiple results, sent one by one in detached thread
  - `SimulateEvents` — system events
- **UaExpert config**: `IJT_LOCAL_SIMULATOR.uap` (read-only reference; do not modify)
- **Details**: read `OPC_UA_Servers/Release2/docs/SKILLS.md`

### Server Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `OPCUA_SERVER_PORT` | `40451` | Override port — used by CI to run parallel isolated instances |
| `OPCUA_HOSTNAME` | `localhost` | Override advertised hostname — used for Docker with remote clients |

---

## CI/CD

**Workflows**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/integration.yml`, and `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (all at **repo root**)

### CI (`ci.yml`) — triggers on every push/PR to `main`
| Job | What it tests |
|-----|--------------|
| `web-client-python` | Web Client Python Phase 1 runner: unit/type/security/audit checks and timing artifacts |
| `web-client-js` | Web Client JavaScript Phase 1 runner: Vitest, ESLint, stylelint, npm audit, and timing artifacts |
| `console-client` | Python unit tests (`tests/unit/`), Bandit, Ruff, mypy |
| `node-client` | JS unit tests, ESLint, npm audit |
| `docker-smoke` | Web Client Docker image smoke/readiness check |
| `test-client` | pytest unit tests (`tests/unit/`) + Bandit, Ruff, mypy |
| `csharp-unit` | dotnet restore (locked mode) + build (`-warnaserror`) + xUnit unit tests (`Category!=Live`, `--blame-hang 60s`) + format check (`dotnet format --verify-no-changes`) |
| `csharp-vuln` | NuGet vulnerability scan (`--vulnerable --include-transitive`); fails on known CVEs |
| `server-smoke-windows` | Windows native EXE smoke test (port 40451) |
| `actionlint` | GitHub Actions syntax/static validation for workflow changes |
| `zizmor` | GitHub Actions security audit with SARIF upload to Code Scanning; local root-runner parsing fails High/Critical findings from current zizmor v1 JSON output |
| `pre-commit` | Runs `.pre-commit-config.yaml` on all files with npm-backed JS hooks skipped because dedicated JS jobs already own them |
| `report` | Downloads all artifacts · publishes dorny/test-reporter Checks tab (per-test drill-down) · writes summary table to Actions Summary with full pass · fail · skip counts · coverage/threshold cells from each client gate · skip-budget and coverage-threshold warnings · artifact sanity gate warns on missing XMLs · `continue-on-error` on all dorny steps (fork PR safe) |

Runtime: ~5–7 minutes. Python 3.14, Node.js 24, .NET 10 everywhere.
Action versions: `checkout@v6`, `setup-python@v6`, `setup-node@v6`, `setup-dotnet@v5`, `upload-artifact@v7`, `download-artifact@v8`
All jobs have explicit `timeout-minutes` (5–30 min) and `permissions: contents: read` (plus `checks: write` where dorny/test-reporter runs inline).
Connection-layer Web Client JavaScript is linted with a scoped security guard:
`Math.random()` is forbidden in `connection-manager.mjs` and future
`connection/auth/**`, `connection/token/**`, and `connection/nonce/**` modules;
connection/session identifiers use Web Crypto (`crypto.randomUUID()` /
`crypto.getRandomValues()`) instead. Existing non-security uses such as
WebSocket retry jitter stay allowed outside the guard.

### CodeQL (`codeql.yml`) — triggers on every push/PR to `main` + weekly
Advanced Setup (GitHub Default Setup disabled). Uses `security-extended` queries.
| Language | Build method | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| C# | `dotnet build` (manual) | Types/ generated code excluded via `paths-ignore` in `codeql-config.yml` |
| Python | autobuild | venv, node_modules, __pycache__ excluded |
| JavaScript | autobuild | node_modules excluded |

### Port Ownership

| Job | Workflow | Port | Protocol |
|-----|----------|------|----------|
| `csharp-unit` | `ci.yml` | — | No server (unit tests only) |
| `csharp-vuln` | `ci.yml` | — | No server (NuGet scan only) |
| `server-smoke-windows` | `ci.yml` | 40451 | Windows native EXE (server self-test) |
| `server-smoke-docker` | `integration.yml` | 40451 | Docker Linux (server self-test) |
| `server-linux-package-smoke` | local root runner | 40465 | Docker image built from Linux package ZIP |
| `web-client-live-opcua-direct` | local root runner + `integration.yml` | OPC UA 40463 | Direct Python OPC UA and method tests |

Root-level `python run_all_tests.py` includes `server-smoke` in default Phase 2 so local full validation exercises the native/default server package path on port 40451. When Docker is running, it also runs `server-linux-package-smoke` on port 40465 to build the Docker image from the Linux ZIP package and smoke-test it, plus `web-client-docker-smoke` for the Web Client production image/readiness check. Root-runner Docker smoke uses isolated host ports 3008/8011 and a scoped Compose project so it can run beside other Web Client suites. If Docker is unavailable, the root runner marks those Docker suites skipped instead of launching child runners that would fail on Docker daemon startup. Set `IJT_DOCKER_BUILD_TIMEOUT` for cold image builds or `IJT_DOCKER_COMPOSE_WAIT_TIMEOUT` for slow first container startup.
The root runner splits Web Client live/browser validation by test type instead
of using one broad Web Client live suite. Python OPC UA, Python WebSocket
backend, Python WebSocket lifecycle, Playwright smoke, Playwright features, and
Playwright regression are separate suites with owned service ports. Docker
validation remains `web-client-docker-smoke` with its own timeout when Docker is
running.
The Playwright feature suite is parallelized across four owned backend/server
pairs. Worker 0 uses the base ports, and workers 1–3 use the next contiguous
ports, so browser workers never share a WebSocket backend or OPC UA simulator.
GitHub integration runs the same Web Client live/e2e suites through the root
runner matrix, split by execution surface. The non-browser Web Client live
suites stay on `windows-latest` because they validate Python/backend behavior
against the Windows simulator package. All `web-client-e2e-*` Playwright suites
run `python run_all_tests.py --suite` **inside** the owned
`ghcr.io/umati/ua-for-industrial-joining-technologies/ijt-browser-ci`
image, digest-pinned via the reviewed
`.github/docker/ijt-browser-ci/image-pin.json`, and started with
`docker run --network=none`.
Chromium, its Linux system dependencies, the locked `@playwright/test`
version, the Python 3.14 toolchain, and the Node 24 toolchain are all
baked into the image — the host runner never reaches `npx playwright install
chromium --with-deps`. The job
deliberately does NOT declare a job-level `container:` image because
GitHub creates container-job runtimes before any workflow step runs, so
a registry pull failure (transient MCR outage, network reroute, etc.)
would take the whole job down with no in-job retry, fallback, or
diagnostics possible. Browser Features remains split into two
Playwright shards; CI defaults to two feature workers per shard,
while local root runs keep the default four-worker feature pool.
The separate `web-client-compatibility-smoke.yml` workflow is the
Web Client — Browser Compatibility Smoke detection layer. It runs only on
schedule/manual dispatch with a matrix that currently contains one cell:
`windows-latest` / `msedge`.
It executes exactly the two audited specs: Result bundle import through the
visible file chooser path and Result bundle JSON export through browser
download handling. It is non-blocking because it is not a required
branch-protection check; the test step itself still fails red and opens or
updates the stable issue key
`[Web Client Compatibility Smoke] windows-latest / msedge`.
Joint Demo feature tests wait for the active `ProductInstanceUri` to resolve
before calling demo methods; the Web UI does not fire Joint Demo methods while
only a bundled sample Settings URI is available.

> Release 1 Node Client always uses 40451 (fixed — no dynamic port support).
> Server self-tests (smoke) correctly use 40451 — they test the server in its native configuration.
> All Release 2 client jobs now use dedicated isolated ports.

### Integration (`integration.yml`) — nightly + path-triggered
Triggers on: `OPC_UA_Servers/**`, all Web Client files, `IJT_Test_Client/**`, Console Client live/deps, or workflow file change.
| Job | What it tests |
|-----|--------------|
| `server-smoke-docker` | Full Docker build + server smoke (10/10) |
| `webclient-docker` | Web Client Docker test image (Python unit + JS unit) + HTTP:3000 production health |
| `int-testclient` | Windows live: Test Client full suite against server on port 40462 |
| `live-webclient` | Windows live matrix: root-runner Web Client live/e2e suites with owned services and per-suite artifacts |
| `live-console` | Windows live: Console Client live tests — server on port 40461 |
| `csharp-live` | Windows live: C# xUnit live tests (nightly drift detection) — server on port 40464 |
| `report` | Downloads integration artifacts and publishes pass/fail/skip totals, test-count deltas from `tests/baselines/integration-test-counts.json`, non-failing skip/test drift warnings, per-job wall-clock durations from the current run jobs API, split Web live/browser rows, and Browser Features / C# Live timing tables |

Runtime: ~10–15 minutes (int-testclient, live-webclient matrix jobs, live-console, csharp-live all run in parallel). Web Client GUI/JS changes now trigger integration because the live matrix includes Playwright smoke/features/regression suites.
Use the report timing tables for CI performance decisions: Browser Features comes from Web Client `timing-latest.json` artifacts, and C# Live comes from `results-csharp-live/tests.trx` per-test durations.
The `Job Durations` section is best-effort and non-failing; it uses the GitHub Actions jobs API for the current run, marks the longest completed job, and excludes the report job itself because a report cannot measure its own completed duration.
Update `tests/baselines/integration-test-counts.json` manually in a normal code review when an intentional suite count or expected skip-count change lands; drift is reported loudly but never fails the report job.
Skip tolerance is zero by default; only high-volume or matrix-aggregated live suites get a small explicit tolerance so routine skip churn stays visible without hiding real drift. Web live and browser artifacts are tracked separately as `wc_live` and `wc_browser`, so any new XML-producing Web matrix row must update the matching baseline in the same review.
All jobs have explicit `timeout-minutes` (5–45 min) and `permissions: contents: read`.

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| asyncua pinned in `constraints.txt` | Python 3.14.4 support requires upstream SHA `35a77c6b` until a tagged PyPI release carries the fix |
| Monkey-patch `_send_request` timeout | asyncua `UaClient.call()` has hardcoded 1s timeout |
| Subscribe events on Server node, not method nodes | Subscribing on individual nodes causes `BadNoSubscription` under load |
| Use provided Python only in pre-isolated environments (`IS_DOCKER=true` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`) | Docker and GitHub Actions already provide isolation; local runs use IJT-owned venvs |
| No `scripts/` at repo root | Each project owns its own helpers; nothing shared at root level |
| `Python/network_utils.py` canonical | Shared network helpers live in this module; all imports use `from Python.network_utils import ...` |
| `ruff target-version = "py313"` (not py314) | ruff 0.15.x bug #24041: `ruff format` with py314 strips parens from `except (A, B):` → Python 2 syntax. py313 is the workaround; guard test `test_ruff_format_guard.py` in Console + Test Client unit suites catches any regression. Restore to py314 once upstream fixes #24041 |
| No custom EventFilter | Full `ResultDataType` payload arrives in event without custom filter |
| C# live-test sync OPC UA calls wrapped in hard timeouts | `BrowseChild`, `Subscribe`, `CallMethod`, and `Unsubscribe` are synchronous and can stall under server load; guarded `Task.WhenAny` timeouts prevent test-host hangs |
| `JoiningSystem.DisposeAsync` cleanup guard timeout | Management-object dispose calls can perform synchronous network operations; timeout-bounded cleanup (8s management + 10s session close) avoids indefinite teardown stalls |
| Console live tests override coverage gate (`--cov-fail-under=0`) | Live tests intentionally exercise a narrow surface against a live server; global unit-test coverage threshold should not fail live stage |
| `pre-commit` as sole hook manager (no Husky) | Polyglot monorepo best practice — one hook manager for all languages. `pre-commit` handles Python + JS + YAML + TOML uniformly, and JS linting is wired via `npm --prefix` local hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Do not add a second hook manager for subprojects. |
| `coverlet.runsettings` passed via `--settings` in CI | Without `--settings`, `ExcludeByNamespace` (UAModel, Program) and `[GeneratedCode]` exclusions are ignored — auto-generated code inflates C# line count and deflates coverage % |
| `playwright/test` import (not `@playwright/test` package) | Node Client has `playwright` (not `@playwright/test`) in `package.json`. `playwright` exposes the same test API at `playwright/test`. Avoids adding a second overlapping Playwright package. |
| `pytest_sessionfinish` cleanup hook in Web Client `conftest.py` | `__pycache__` and `tmp/pytest` created by direct `pytest` invocations are cleaned up post-session even when `run_all_tests.py` is not used. Keeps project tree clean on every run path. |
