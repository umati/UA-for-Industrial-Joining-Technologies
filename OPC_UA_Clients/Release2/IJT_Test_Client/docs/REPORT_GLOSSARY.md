# IJT Report Glossary and Reading Guide

**Status:** authoritative in-repo terminology reference for the IJT Test
Client conformance summary renderer
(`scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py`) and the Excel parity report
(`scripts/make_excel_report.py`).

**Audience tags:** 👔 management - 🛠 dev - 🧪 test - 📦 customer

This glossary defines every term that appears in:
- the Test Client conformance summary (`scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py`,
 invoked via `scripts/make_conformance_summary.py` from
 `.github/workflows/integration.yml`)
- the repo-wide CI summary table (`reporting/ci_run_summary.py`, invoked by
 `.github/workflows/ci.yml` job `report`)
- the System Tests summary (`reporting/system_tests_run_summary.py`, invoked by
 `.github/workflows/integration.yml`)
- the Excel parity report (`scripts/make_excel_report.py`)
- the workflow display names and Checks tab

Source citations below identify code by **symbol** (function, constant,
section heading, or unique header string) rather than line number, so they
stay valid as code moves. If a cited symbol is renamed or removed, treat
it as a glossary bug and fix it in the same PR that touches the symbol.

## 1. Workflow names (top of run page) 👔 🛠️ 🧪 📦

| Current display name | Source anchor | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `CI — Unit, Static, and Smoke Gates` | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`name:` field) | Pull-request gate for unit suites, static analysis, vulnerability scans, and required smoke checks. |
| `System Tests — Live OPC UA, Browser, Docker, Conformance` | `.github/workflows/integration.yml` (`name:` field) | Nightly + manual full system run against live OPC UA server, browser end-to-end suites, Docker compose, and conformance harness. |
| `Security — CodeQL` | `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (`name:` field) | GitHub native code scanning. Matrix job names `Analyze (javascript)`, `Analyze (csharp)`, and `Analyze (python)` stay unchanged because ruleset `15294123` requires those contexts. |
| `Web Client — Browser Compatibility Smoke` | `.github/workflows/web-client-compatibility-smoke.yml` (`name:` field) | Scheduled/manual browser smoke for audited Web Client file surfaces. The issue key `[Web Client Compatibility Smoke]` stays unchanged for continuity. |

> 👔 management: the names describe the purpose of the run. Required branch-protection contexts are governed by the GitHub ruleset, not by these display labels.

## 1.1 Summary status marker contract

| Visual meaning | Report marker | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pass / completed | `✅` | Successful gate, check, or validated outcome. |
| Failure | `❌` | Failed gate, check, or CU outcome. |
| Current bottleneck | `🏁` | Longest reliable timing source in the current run. |
| Skipped / neutral | `⏭️` / `⚪` | Skipped lane/check or neutral capability-scope fact. |

## 2. Conformance report top-level terms

### 2.1 `📊 Conformance Overview` 👔 🛠️ 🧪 📦
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` (`## 📊 Conformance Overview` heading and KPI table emitted in `render_conformance_summary()`).
Rendered as a **four-column KPI strip** (`Server Support Coverage` | `Validation Health` | `Action Items` | `Informational Notes`) **plus a four-cell context row** beneath it. The previous `✅` decoration was removed from the `Validation Health` header so all KPI labels are plain text.

`Action Items` renders **`Failed` · `Blocked`** and means work to investigate or fix. `Informational Notes` renders **`Not Supported` · `With Notes`** and means capability gaps or caveats for context.

**Why renamed:** the old "At a Glance" wording was informal; non-IJT readers (management, customers) parsed it as "look here for everything," not "high-level KPIs." `Conformance Overview` says exactly what the block contains.

**v4.8.2 polish:** the Capability Support full table now splits the support icon into its own `🚦` column, and the Capability Support / Conformance Overview sections include one-line legends for support and review icon meanings.

### 2.2 `Server Support Coverage` 👔 🛠️ 📦
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` — `Server Support Coverage` column header in the `## 📊 Conformance Overview` KPI table; value is the local `spec_coverage_value` computed in `render_conformance_summary()`.
The share of OPC 40100 Joining Test Result CUs (Conformance Units) that the **server under test claims to support** in its capability file.
- **Numerator:** CUs the server lists as supported.
- **Denominator:** CUs in the active profile (facet or full set).
- Example: 78% means the server says it supports 78% of the CUs in the active profile.
**Why renamed:** "Spec Coverage" suggested test coverage of the spec, which it is not. The value is about **what the server says it supports**, not what the tests cover.

### 2.3 `Validation Health` 👔 🛠️ 🧪 📦
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` — `Validation Health` column header in the `## 📊 Conformance Overview` KPI table; value is the local `validation_health_value` computed in `render_conformance_summary()` via `_supported_cus_validated_pct_value()`.
The share of server-supported CUs that this run validated as **Supported** or **Supported with Notes**.
- **Numerator:** CUs validated as Supported or Supported with Notes.
- **Denominator:** CUs the server says it supports.
- Example: 95% means 95% of the CUs the server claims to support were proven by tests.
**Note:** Formula stays as-is. Any future weighting change requires a separate proposal document and PR.

### 2.4 `Action Items` and `Informational Notes` 👔 🛠️ 🧪 📦
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` — `Action Items` and `Informational Notes` column headers in the `## 📊 Conformance Overview` KPI table; cells rendered via `_format_status_counts(...)` from `helpers/report_scoring.py` (the `findings_count` Counter is built in `render_conformance_summary()`).
Compressed status counts across all CUs. The split renders the four KPI labels from `KPI_LABELS` in `helpers/report_scoring.py` as two reader layers:

```
Action Items: Failed · Blocked
Informational Notes: Not Supported · With Notes
```

There is **no `Supported` count in these cells** — they only highlight buckets that need follow-up or explanation.

There is no formula change and no new bucket. The internal JSON key remains `action_needed`; the public report label is `Failed`.

### 2.5 Score 🛠️ 🧪
Source: formula lives in `conformance_score()` in `helpers/report_scoring.py`; called as `_conformance_score(...)` inside `render_conformance_summary()` in `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py`; rendered as the `**Score: …**` banner emitted by the same function.
0–100 composite, currently `0.7 × Validation Health + 0.3 × Server Support Coverage`,
capped at 50 if any internal `action_needed` / public **Failed** item exists, capped at 75 if any **Blocked** item exists.
**Note on taxonomy:** the internal source term is still `action_needed`; the public report label is `Failed`.

## 3. Outcome / status terms

### 3.1 `Review Status` and `Outcome` 🛠️ 🧪
The report deliberately keeps two concepts:
- `Review Status` highlights follow-up work for the reader (`Failed`, `Blocked`, `Not Supported`, `With Notes`).
- `Outcome` is the CU-level conformance classification for the current run.

Current table shapes:
- Compact review table: `Review Status | CU | Outcome | Primary Reason | Change` when at least one row changed since the previous baseline; otherwise the `Change` column is omitted.
- `Conformance Status` collapsed `<details>` table: includes `Review Status`, `Outcome`, and `Failures`.
- `Full CU Coverage` collapsed `<details>` table: includes `Outcome` and `Failures` (no `Review Status` column).
- Coverage aggregate tables may show `Outcomes | Outcome`: `Outcomes` is the aggregate count column, while `Outcome` is the per-row classification.

| Outcome | Icon | Meaning | Internal source term | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Supported | ✅ | Test validated this CU as supported. | `Supported` | `OUTCOME_LABELS["supported"]` in `helpers/report_scoring.py` |
| Supported with Notes | ⚠ | Validated but with caveats (e.g., partial coverage). Mapped from `partial` key. | `Supported with Notes` (KPI strip uses short form `With Notes` from `KPI_LABELS`) | `OUTCOME_LABELS["partial"]`, `KPI_LABELS` in `helpers/report_scoring.py` |
| Not Supported | ➖ | Server-supported CU was not validated as supported by this run. | `Not Supported` | `OUTCOME_LABELS["not_supported"]` in `helpers/report_scoring.py` |
| Blocked | 🚫 | Missing runtime precondition (e.g., dependency CU failed). | `Blocked` | `OUTCOME_LABELS["blocked"]` in `helpers/report_scoring.py` |
| Failed | ❌ | Test failure or harness/runtime error. | `action_needed` | `OUTCOME_LABELS["action_needed"]`, `ACTION_ITEM_LABEL_ORDER` in `helpers/report_scoring.py` |

The internal JSON key remains `action_needed` so existing machine-readable data stays stable. The public label is `Failed`.

### 3.2 `Failures` 🛠️ 🧪
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` — `Failures` column header in both the `Conformance Status` and `Full CU Coverage` collapsed `<details>` tables; Excel parity in the `Failures` column emitted by `make_excel_report.py`.
The single count of failures and harness/runtime errors. The code already collapses these into one number; the column name now matches the existing Excel sheet name `Failures` built by `_build_filtered(..., "Failures", ...)` in `make_excel_report.py`.

> Note: The column `Failures` counts pytest `failed + errors`. The CU **outcome** label `Failed` is not the same field: `Failures` is a per-CU count of underlying test failures+errors; `Failed` is the CU-level outcome bucket.

---

## 4. Coverage and capability terms

### 4.1 `Facet and CU Coverage` 🛠️ 🧪
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` — `Facet and CU Coverage` `<details>` block; full capability-area details are emitted by `_render_supports_block()`.
The table of facet-level rows that breaks down validation by facet of the OPC 40100 IJT profile, plus the Reference IJT facet and Reference full CU set rows.
**Why renamed:** the table contains both facets and CU-level rows; the old name hid the CU rows.

### 4.2 `Informational Notes` 🛠️ 🧪
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` — `## 📝 Informational Notes` section in `_render_review_sections()`; filter uses `_CAPABILITY_NOTE_LABELS` (= {Not Supported, Supported with Notes}, imported from `helpers/report_scoring.py`).
Per-CU notes about CUs that are **not** action items (no failure, no block) but still need explanation.
**Why not `Exceptions`:** "Exception" has a specific meaning in the OPC UA spec (StatusCode-bearing condition); reusing that term in the report would be confusing.

### 4.3 `Coverage Overview` (label kept) 👔 🛠️ 🧪 📦
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` section heading.
A small table summarizing how much of the active profile each row covered. Numbers are independent of pass/fail; they express **breadth**, not **success**.

### 4.4 `Full CU Coverage` (label kept) 🛠️ 🧪
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` collapsed `<details>` block.
The full list of every CU in the active profile with its individual outcome.

### 4.5 `Skip Diagnostics` 🛠️ 🧪
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` section heading.
Skip-reason histogram for diagnostic purposes only. Skip counts here **overlap** with CU outcomes above and should not be added to them.

## 5. Document structure terms

### 5.1 `Glossary and Reading Guide` 👔 🛠️ 🧪 📦
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` section heading.
The trailing section that defines terms inline inside the generated report. This file is the authoritative in-repo terminology reference.

### 5.2 `Conformance Status` (label kept) 🛠️ 🧪
Source: `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` collapsed `<details>` block heading.
The detail table of action items and informational notes that need explanation.

### 5.3 `Change Since Last Run` (block) 🛠️ 🧪
Source: baseline read by `_load_baseline()` in `scripts/make_conformance_summary.py`; change block emitted by `_render_delta_block()` in `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py`; baseline payload built by `_baseline_payload()` in `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py`; baseline write by `_write_baseline()` in `scripts/make_conformance_summary.py` (invoked from `main()`).
Comparison with the previously persisted `test-results/report-baseline.json`.
When no baseline exists, the block is **hidden**, not shown with an empty message.

---

## 6. Timing diagnostics terms

### 6.1 `Bottleneck Spotlight` (new in Phase 3) 🛠️ 🧪
Auto-detects the slowest current job/suite and appears inside the System Tests `⏱️ Performance Hotspots` section. Replaces the former hardcoded C# live-test spotlight.
**Why auto:** the longest pole changes over time (Phase 3 Q15). Hardcoding "C# Live Tests" hid Web Client regressions when they became slower than C#.

### 6.2 Timing layers (Phase 8) 🛠️ 🧪
- **Layer 1 (always visible):** top timing-source table built from current workflow jobs, Web Browser timing JSON, C# TRX artifacts, and Test Client JUnit durations when available.
- **Layer 2 (always visible):** `Bottleneck Spotlight`.
- **Layer 3 (`<details>` collapsed):** top-10 detail tables for available Web Browser, C# Live, and Test Client Conformance timing artifacts.

## 7. Cross-report parity (Markdown ↔ Excel) 🛠️ 🧪
- Every term rendered in `scripts/reporting/conformance_summary.py` is rendered in lockstep in `make_excel_report.py`.
- Excel sheet `Failures` is the canonical name and is preserved (`_build_filtered(..., "Failures", ...)` in `make_excel_report.py`).
- Excel terminology source: column-header constants and sheet builders in `scripts/make_excel_report.py`.

---

## 8. Out of scope for this glossary
- Tier definitions (`docs/TEST_TIERS.md`). The stale C# skip-count claim was fixed in Phase 7.
- Internal-only Python identifiers (`_ACTION_ITEM_LABEL_ORDER`, etc.) — these are implementation details and not user-facing.
- CI/CD plumbing terms not appearing in the rendered report.

---

## 9. Internal implementation terms

The source data still uses the internal discriminator **`rollup`** for grouped
facet definitions. The renderer and Excel workbook expose those rows as
**`Facet Group`**.

Internal Python (`kind == "rollup"` discriminator, `rollups` list variable) may
stay as-is because it is not user-visible.
